## FAQ
Why not *X* css framework? In a nutshell, I’ve looked at a **ton** of frameworks, and if I had the time and inclination, [Bulma](http://bulma.io) might be something I’d write. It allows for focus on the functionality of the theme and not writing all of the CSS from scratch, yet room for an original feel.

Will you support *Y*? Maybe. As long as it furthers the goal of having an easy to get up and running WordPress theme using IndieWeb principles.
