** Work in Progress ** code was pushed to GitHub before ready, now developing in open.

WordPress theme with IndieWeb support baked in. You have permission to free your content from silos.

Permission aims to be a WordPress theme built to get you up and running quickly with the IndieWeb, while having ability to easily personalize.

Specifically, support out-of-the-box for the primary IndieWeb WordPress plugins:

* [webmentions](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention)
* [micropub](https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/)
* [semantic-linkbacks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/)
* [post-kinds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/)
* [syndication links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/)
* webmention-comments

## FAQ
Why not *X* css framework? In a nutshell, I’ve looked at a **ton** of frameworks, and if I had the time and inclination, [Bulma](http://bulma.io) might be something I’d write. It allows for focus on the functionality of the theme and not writing all of the CSS from scratch, yet room for an original feel.

Will you support *Y*? Maybe. As long as it furthers the goal of having an easy to get up and running WordPress theme using IndieWeb principles.
